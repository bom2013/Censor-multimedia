# Censor multimedia
The software allows you to censor video files

* Import censorship snippets from CNS files
* Export censorship snippets to CNS files
* Working with different video formats
* Classification of censorship segments according to levels  
# How to use?
You have two options:
1. Clone the repo and build the code
2. Download [Realese folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bom2013/Censor-multimedia/master/Release.zip)
# How its work?
## Overall?  
You upload a video to the software, choose which sections to censor and the software releases a file in which the sections are censored

Yes, as you hear, it's that simple :)
## And in detail?
1. The user uploads the video to the software
2. The user selects which sections to censor (either by manually adding censorship sections or by uploading a CNS file) and classifies their level
2. The user chooses which level he wants to censor  

Then there are 2 options:
1. Export to a video file (this is a m3u8 file, ie a playlist file that contains the relevant sections)
2. Export the censorship snippets to the CNS file
